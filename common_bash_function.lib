##
## 2020-04-22 *f_message split into several functions for clarity and
##             simplicity f_msg_(txt/ui)_(file/string)_(ok/nok).
##            *f_yn_question split off f_yn_defaults.
##
## 2020-04-19 *Found bug in VERSION setting in f_about, f_code_history,
##             f_help_message. Need to set $VERSION using correct $THIS_FILE.
##
## 2020-04-18 *Fixed bug affecting menu items "About", "Code History",
##             and "Help" where f_update menu_gui/txt did not substitute
##             the "^" <carot> for <space> in FUNC="f_<function>^$GUI".
##             So $1 was never set to $GUI when calling f_about,
##             f_code_history, and f_help_message.
##
## 2020-04-15 *Standardized code to latest implementations.
##            *f_message total rewrite to handle text file, strings with
##             or without embedded "/n" or "/Zn" commands.
##
## 2020-04-07 *Cosmetic formatting changes in if-then, case, statements
##             and comment lines.
##
## 2020-04-06 *f_arguments standardized.
##
## 2020-04-06 *Initial Release.
